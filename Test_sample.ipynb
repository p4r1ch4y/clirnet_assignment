        "    Abstract\n",
        "    Cereal-legume intercropping and organic amendments are promising strategies to boost crop productivity, land use efficiency, and sustainability. However, their performance varies depending on pedo-climatic zones and crop types. In Denmark, pea-barley intercrop is commonly practiced for seed harvest and fodder production. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of organic amendments on productivity, nitrogen (N) uptake, and barley grain protein in pea-barley intercrops (PB IC) compared to sole crops. A field trial was conducted using a strip-plot design with three cropping systems—PB IC, pea sole (PS), and barley sole (BS) with six organic amendment treatments: control (T0), biochar (T1), compost (T2), insect frass (T3), vermicompost (T4), and pelletized frass (T5). Averaged across organic amendments, PB IC increased aboveground dry biomass (AGDB) by 18–57% and grain yield by 12–135% compared to sole crops. Grain N-uptake under PB IC increased by 66–94%, compared to sole crops. PB IC suppressed weed biomass by 83% relative to PS. Averaged across cropping systems, T5 increased grain yield by 105%, N-uptake in straw by 49%, and in grains by 101%, compared to T0. Land equivalent ratio (LER) ranged from 1.15-2.47 across treatments, indicating improved land use efficiency. Barley protein content was consistently higher in PB IC than in BS. PB IC combined with organic amendments—particularly pelletized frass, significantly increased crop yield, land use efficiency, N-uptake, and grain quality. This field study provides robust evidence of the multiple benefits of integrating pea-barley intercropping with organic amendments for sustainable intensification.\n",
